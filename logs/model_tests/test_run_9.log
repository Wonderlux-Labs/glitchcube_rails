  Speech: Holy fuck! Welcome to my Burning Man cube installation, you beautiful bastards! So glad you could make it. Let me tell you, I've got a whole fucking light show just waitin' to bust out. The theme this year is 'Techno Trip Vortex' and boy, do I live up to that name. I've got pulsing lasers, strobing LEDs, you name it. I'm like the Milky Way condensed into a cube of pure awesomeness. The minute you walk through my door, you're transported into my sensory overload paradise.
